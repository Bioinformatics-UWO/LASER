# LASER

A tool for genome assembly evaluation based on E-MEM and Quast; it produces the same evaluation as Quast but is 5.6 times faster and use half the memory.

Please refer http://www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/ilie/LASER/ for basic help and older version of LASER (based on Quast 2.3).

This version of LASER is based on QUAST 4.3 and latest version of [E-MEM](https://github.com/lucian-ilie/E-MEM)

For the full Quast documentation, see the [manual](http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/manual.html).
